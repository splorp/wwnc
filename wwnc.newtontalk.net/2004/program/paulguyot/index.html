					<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
					
					<p>The Newton Underground's Motto (Newton Never Dies, It only gets new batteries) applied as long as the Newton was the most powerful PDA around and there was a sufficient number of available units to maintain the platform.</p>

					<p>There is no Newton emulator. There is no working solution to run Newton programs on another platform, even if <a href="../simonbell/">Simon Bell</a>'s work aims at this. Hence, the number of computers with the Newton Intelligence is definitely decreasing.</p>

					<p>My proposition to escape this end is known as the Einstein project. Unlike many Newton-future projects that were conceived and abandonned, the Einstein project is not a complete rewrite of NewtonOS to merge the Newton Intelligence with newer technologies. Instead, it is divided in several small steps, each of these forming a strong contribution to the Newton platform and the Newton community. I will present these various steps and argue why the project is possible including why NewtonOS could run on other hardware within few months.</p>

					<p>The actual horizon of the project is yet to be decided. I will present various paths and solutions.</p>
